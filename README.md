##  Project Overview

The aim of this study is to minimize the emergency response time of fire stations in Istanbul by modeling real traffic and demand data. The problem is approached as a facility location optimization using:

- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Several static and dynamic scenarios were evaluated, visualized, and compared using result maps and cost analyses.

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- LaTeX (IEEEtran)
- Git & GitHub
